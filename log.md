# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 26, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Cloned my own repo, 100Days repo and Javascript30 to my new computer. Config'd my user name and email address in git because all the work that I had done during my JS course was not showing up in my contribution chart.

**Thoughts:** READ and FOCUS! You got this!

**Today's Progress**: Added video source object to my random rueda call generator and it worked. Need to find out how to hide the iframe on page load. I'm using the same video for testing purposes but I need to find videos for all the rueda calls.

**Thoughts**: I didn't spend a full hour today and I feel guilty since it's day 2! I have to attend a function but I'm hoping to get a little more coding in today. It was a stressful day for a Friday.

<!--## Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
