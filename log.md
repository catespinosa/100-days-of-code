# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 26, 2017
#####

**Today's Progress**: Cloned my own repo, 100Days repo and Javascript30 to my new computer. Config'd my user name and email address in git because all the work that I had done during my JS course was not showing up in my contribution chart.

**Thoughts:** READ and FOCUS! You got this!

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
